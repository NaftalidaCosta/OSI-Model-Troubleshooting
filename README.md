# OSI-Model-Troubleshooting
Learn troubleshooting techniques that can be applied at each layer.

## Physical Layer:
```
When you use a bottom-up approach to diagnose connectivity problems, you begin at the Physical layer of the OSI model by verifying network connections and device availability.

For example, a wireless device may have power to the antenna or transceiver temporarily turned off. A wireless access point may have lost power because a circuit breaker was tripped offline or a fuse was blown. Similarly, a network cable connection may be loose, or the cable may be damaged.

Thus, before you begin inspecting service architectures, you should start with the basics: Confirm physical connectivity.```
